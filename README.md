# bundles-demo

This repository is an Expresia app that will help you quickly get started with Expresia Git Bundles. 
We suggest cloning down the repository, and taking a look at both template.hbs in xpr/element and template.json in xpr/element_config. By cloning this Expresia app, it will allow you to look/edit/test the code on your own Expresia Instance. It is recommended to follow along with our video for ease of understanding. You can see a live version of this repository running over at the [expresia-gitbundles-demo.xpr.cloud](https://expresia-gitbundles-demo.xpr.cloud/)

Git Bundles integration for Expresia is a new, completely Git based workflow that lets you work with familiar concepts like Elements, Datasources, Serverside Scripts and more, directly through Git using either your own self-hosted solution, or a popular provider such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). 

The main audience for this demo is existing developers working within Expresia looking for a quick start guide on Git Bundle integration as well as build on existing techniques that will be familiar to individuals with experience developing within Expresia.
