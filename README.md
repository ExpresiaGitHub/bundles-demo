# bundles-2-demo

This is a preliminary demonstration of Bundles 2.0 - a new system for creating Git based code which can run within the Expression environment.

The audience is primarily existing users of Expression who may be looking to migrate existing bundles two the new 2.0 system, which supports Git "out of the box" and allows you as an individual or organization to manage your own code workflow, while still leveraging the power of Expression.
